# Tensorflow Chatbot

Implementation of Tensorflows [Sequence to Sequence](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html) model to train a
chatbot on the [Cornell Movie Dialogue dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html).


To train the bot, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to train like so

`mode = train`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``

To test the bot during or after training, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to test like so

`mode = test`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``
